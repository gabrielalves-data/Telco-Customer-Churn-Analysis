# Profit Curve Optimization

Traditional metrics do not directly optimize financial return.  
Using campaign cost, CLTV, True Positive/False Positive costs:

* Expected profit calculated across probability thresholds  
* The global maximum profit occurs at **0.113**

This threshold balances:
* Cost of false negatives (lost customer)
* Cost of false positives (wasted intervention)

Outcome: **$1,253,729 expected profit**
